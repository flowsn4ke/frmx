- [ ] Callback on unmount if unsubmitted updates

## Performance
- [ ] Benchmark array methods and see if there's room for improvement
- [ ] Custom .map function?

## DX Error handling
- [ ] Should we console.error when a field does not exist
- [ ] Should we continue to allow multiple instances of one field? Warn the user in dev mode?
